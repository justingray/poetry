Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore

Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore
From that rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore

And the silky sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Made me so totally scared
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating

By Edgar Allen Poe
